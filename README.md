# twitchChatCLI

I'm archiving this project. It was fun to see it pick up usage but I just don't have the time to chase the edge cases. Rendering unicode correctly across many
terminal clients is probably impossible. Trying to print with proper, cute formatting transforms unicode from jank into hard crashes and that just sucks. 

It could probably fixed eventually with extensive testing and upstream pull requests but again it just isn't worth the effort.
