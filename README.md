## Usage

Download the correct binary from the [releases](https://github.com/SimplySerenity/twitchChatCLI/releases)

Then run it from your terminal like so:

```
./twitchChatCLI channelnamehere
```

Your browser should open and ask you to verify and that's about it!

Also, if you want a very minimal look you can do

```
CLEAN=true ./twitchChatCLI channelnamehere
```
